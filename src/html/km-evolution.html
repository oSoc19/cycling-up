            Evolution per year of the new cyclable paths created
          </h1>
          <p class="i18n" data-i18n-key="description">
            The total amount of cyclable paths is calculated in kilometers and
            includes the ones separated from the main roads as well as the
            suggested paths and the Regional Cyclable Itineraries (RCI). The
            RCIs are suggested paths for cyclists willing to commute on a medium
            to long distance. They take into account the calmest streets and the
            less stressful paths for the users. A significant year to mention is
            2002, where the political boldness allowed the apparition of a
            project considered as not realistic at its time. Hence, the
            suppression of one row of the Rue de la loi attributed to cars in
            order to construct a larger sideways shared by cyclists and
            pedestrians.
