            The evolution of the number of cyclists variates according to the
            seasons. They are defined by the following months: January, May,
            September and November. This graph depicts the gap between each
            seasons from 1998 till 2017. Each data represents the number of
            cyclists taken randomnly at a t-point. None of these should be taken
            as granted and considered as absolute data.

            The Regional Cycle Routes are suggested paths for cyclists willing
            to commute on a medium to long distance. They take into account the
            calmest streets and the less stressful paths for the users.
