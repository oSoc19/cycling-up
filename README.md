Bicycle infrastructure dashboard for Brussels Mobility.

## About the project
A better Brussels starts on your bike.

We all dream of a better Brussels and we can easily build it together. We can do it by riding our bicycles more often. The more people are cycling, the greener, safer and nicer life will become here.

They gave us the challenge to create a dynamic map showing the bike infrastructure in the region of Brussels. The goal with this is to use this tool in the communication with politicians and residents of Brussels.

Let us make Brussel alive & pedalling!

## Documentation about the front-end
We mainly used HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Those are the easiest languages to learn if you have no experience at all with coding. We created a modular system so it's very easy to reuse and add, adjust or delete components.
